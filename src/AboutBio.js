        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm originally from the USA. My
        coding handle is Magenta Spruce. I have a B.S. in Biology awarded in
        2015. Since leaving the USA in 2015 I have lived and worked / studied in
        Micronesia, Nepal, Thailand, France, and Ukraine.
        <br />
        <br />
        I code in order to develop the skillsets to eventually create fin-tech
        applications for DeFi. I started coding in 2020. Before that, and COVID,
        I had a successful business in Thailand and attended an international
        medical school program in Ukraine.
        <br />
        <br />
        Living and working for many years around the world in various
        enviornments has provided me with a vast array of experiences and
        skillsets in which to pull from. Coding, like medicine, is a very
        meticulous and cerebral affar which I find much enjoyment in. Many days
        it hardly feels like work at all. <br />
        <br />
        I love learning new things everyday and I have a clear bearing in mind
        for the future. However, I would love to meet and work with some of you
        along the way.
        <br />
        <br />
        Teamwork makes the dreamwork after all. I hope we get to work together
        soon ðŸ™‚
        <br />
