      <p className="about-p">
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I'm originally from the USA. My
        coding handle is Magenta Spruce and I have a B.S. in Biology awarded in
        2015. Soon after graduating I left the US and since then have lived and
        worked in Micronesia, Nepal, Thailand, France, and Ukraine.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I code in order to develop the
        skillsets to eventually design, create, and launch fin-tech applications
        for DeFi. I currently use the MERN stack for building out larger
        projects or React for SPA's. I am interested in learning about all
        things technical and programming related. Before coding and COVID I had
        a successful business in Thailand and attended an international medical
        school program in Ukraine.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Living and working for many years
        around the world has provided me with a vast array of experiences,
        skillsets, and understandings.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coding, like medicine, is a very
        meticulous and cerebral affair which requires constant practice and
        attention to become very good at. I myself love the challenge of
        constantly learning new things everyday and am sincerely happy to be on
        such an incredibly bright and uplifting journey as this one.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I'd love to work together to make
        awesome possibilities become reality. Teamwork makes the dreamwork after
        all. I hope we get to work together soon!
        <br />
